# Project 1 - Housing Trends in Philadelphia, PA

## Group Members: Andrew Belfiglio, Arame Diasse, Katy Phillips, Stephen Smith



### We used data from https://www.zillow.com/research/data/ and https://data.census.gov to examine the following questions:

 * How have home and rental prices been trending in Philadelphia?
 
 * How do trends in rental prices in Philadelphia compare to those of the 3 other most populous cities in Pennsylvania?
 
 * What percentage of income is being spent on rent?
 
 * How has occupancy changed?
 
 * Are changes in median income keeping pace with changes in rental prices within different zip codes?
 
 * Are different zip codes being disproportionately affected by changes in home and rental prices?
 
 * Is there a correlation between home prices and the number of tax delinquencies?
 
 ## Data was analyzed at both the city and zip code level.  Our findings showed that while rental prices have increased significantly, the rise in median income has kept pace with those changes.  Occupancy rates have decreased as well, indicating an adequate number of housing units for Philadelphians.  Upon examing the zip code level data, we did see evidence of gentrification in certain areas of the city, with home values rising rapidly in zip codes adjacent to those with strong median income growth.  We also did find a strong correlation in number of tax delinquencies versus percent change in home value prices, indicating pockets of homeowners whose income is not able to keep pace with their home value inflation.
